this is an example of N=2 (a dimer) and the bond confiutreation are measured and histogrammed
in path.inp there are the settings of the simulation
in conf_x.inp there are (hopefully:P ) independent confiturations. However, for a dimer that's not too critical
there configurations will be read if the bodn breaks in the bmd run 
in particles.inp the particles are defined (see init.c for more information about the format)

the files Scoefficient.inp list the critical casimir coefficeients of the switchfunction
