this is an example of a chain (N=10) that is run with bmd and the breakage mechanism/times are measured 
see for more information the paper https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/sm/d3sm01255g

in path.inp there are the settings of the simulation
in conf_x.inp there are (hopefully:P ) independent confiturations. or at least they are somewhat decorrelated chains. 
there configurations will be read if the bodn breaks in the bmd run
in particles.inp the particles are defined (see init.c for more information about the format)

the files Scoefficient.inp list the critical casimir coefficeients of the switchfunction
